# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## What is Wiki-AI-@Home?
Wiki-AI-@Home is an open-source, decentralized AI training system that leverages volunteer computing power to develop ethical AI models without corporate control. It aims to maintain transparency in AI development and uses community-driven validation for data accuracy.

## How can I contribute to Wiki-AI-@Home?
Contributors can participate in several ways:
- **Developers** can help by coding for the AI-@Home client or contributing to the backend of the website.
- **Researchers** can assist in curating and validating datasets.
- **Volunteers** can donate computing power and participate in data validation.
- **Supporters** can help spread awareness and support fundraising efforts.

## Is there any prerequisite knowledge needed to contribute?
While having a background in AI, computing, or web development can be helpful, there are contributions to be made by individuals of all skill levels. Documentation, project management, and community outreach are areas where enthusiasts without a technical background can contribute significantly.

## What are the system requirements to run the AI-@Home client?
The client is designed to be lightweight but effective. Minimum system requirements are:
- Dual-core processor
- 4GB RAM
- 10GB of free disk space
- Internet connection

## How is the privacy of contributors handled?
Privacy is a top priority. Personal data of volunteers is not sold or shared. Contributions to datasets are anonymized, and secure protocols are used for communication and data storage.

## How does Wiki-AI-@Home address ethical concerns in AI development?
The project adheres to strict ethical guidelines, focusing on transparency, accountability, and the impact of AI on society. We ensure that:
- All AI models are trained only on verified, ethically sourced data.
- Bias detection and mitigation are integral parts of our development process.
- The outputs of AI models are continuously monitored and refined to prevent harmful applications.

## What measures are taken to ensure the quality and integrity of AI models?
- Rigorous validation processes are in place to ensure data quality.
- Human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems are utilized to verify model outputs.
- Community feedback is encouraged and incorporated to improve model reliability and trustworthiness.

##How do you justify using AI models that were initially trained in unethical ways for developing ethical AI?
-For a detailed explanation, please see [A Critical examination of using unethical AI to build ethical AI](docs/ethicalAI.txt)

## Why are you developing OptchaNull, and where can I find more about the underlying research and motivations?
-OptchaNull is being developed as an ethical alternative to traditional CAPTCHA systems, which often rely on tasks that can be intrusive and user-unfriendly. Our goal is to create a system that respects user privacy and enhances user experience by utilizing voluntary microtasks that contribute directly to AI training and validation, and being honest about doing so, while offering users the optchan to easily decline participation, and no false sense of security to website partners.
