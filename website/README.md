## ** Models README (Planned AI Models Breakdown)**

### **Core-LLM, AI Training AI:**
- **Small, high-quality language model** optimized for ethical AI use.
- **Trained only on validated, ethical datasets** (no scraped or proprietary data).
- **Designed for decentralized deployment** with community-driven improvements.
- **this will be the first model we develop, and will aid in the development of recursive specialized models.


Each model will have its own README upon initialization of training, outlining:
- **Training data sources -live document as sources have been validated and included**
- **Validation processes**
- **Benchmarking and fine-tuning methodologies**
- **Community involvement opportunities**


## Planned specialized AI Models; 
### The goal is to start small by using off the shelf models to sort and curate the data we're going to train the model on, so that humans can verify it
1. **Assistant AI** – Small, high-quality general AI model, designed to interface with users in a friendly and helpful manner and deligate back end tasks to specialized models in a transparent manner.
2. **Fact-Checking AI** – Cross-references claims with known verified sources
3. **Ethics & Bias Detection AI** – Flags potential ethical concerns in model outputs.
4. **Reasoning & Logic AI** – Improves deductive reasoning and factual coherence.
5. **Creative AI** – Fine-tuned for art, music, and storytelling.
6. **Code Generation AI** – Focused on ethical, high-quality code.
7. **Mathematics & Problem Solving AI** – Designed for accuracy in calculations and scientific and technical problem solving.
8. **Sensory AI ** -Process Technologies best aproximations of human and animal senses, converted to digital input, to integrate an experiential understanding.
9. **Crosstrain AI** AI model will learn alongside professionals and amateurs to incorporate real-world experiences and associate them to training data, potentially offering insight from across lifestyles and industries to improve the human experience wholistically.
