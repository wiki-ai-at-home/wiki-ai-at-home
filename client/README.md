# AI-@Home Client

## Overview
The AI-@Home client is a volunteer-driven computing interface designed to distribute AI training tasks across multiple participant machines. It interfaces with BOINC for optimized compute-sharing and provides a GUI for users to manage resource allocation. The client ensures security, privacy, and controlled background execution, operating minimized in the system tray with start-on-boot functionality.

## Features
- **Resource Allocation Controls**: Allows users to set CPU, GPU, bandwidth, and disk usage limits.
- **Dynamic Throttling**: Automatically adjusts workload based on available system resources.
- **BOINC Integration**: Connects with BOINC for distributed compute task management, ensuring secure task distribution.
- **Task Execution & Reporting**: Runs AI-related workloads and reports back progress.
- **Data Validation Portal**: Provides access to validated datasets for review and refinement.
- **Encrypted P2P Storage** (future implementation): Securely distributes dataset fragments across participating nodes.
- **Background Operation**: Ensures that the client runs efficiently in the background, accessible via the system tray.

## How to Use the Client
1. **Install and Launch**: Run the client on your system to get started.
2. **Set Resource Limits**: Adjust CPU, GPU, and bandwidth usage to fit your needs and available system resources.
3. **Join AI Training**: Allow your system to contribute to training ethical AI models.
4. **Validate Data** (Optional): Participate in refining AI datasets by reviewing text and images.
5. **Monitor Progress**: Track your contributions and system performance.

This client serves as the primary interface for volunteers participating in WikiAI@Home, facilitating user engagement and contribution to ethical AI development.
